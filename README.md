# Hi there, My name is Eloy! 👋

I'm a Biomedical Engineering student passionate about computational neuroscience and software development for data analysis. I love exploring how technology can help us better understand the human brain. Some of the areas I am interested in include:

- 📊 **Data analytics**: I enjoy working with large datasets and discovering hidden patterns.
- 💻 **Python development**: I use Python to develop applications and perform neural model simulations.
- 💻 **Development in R**: I learned how to use R at a bioinformatics internship at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena.
- 🧠 **Computational neuroscience**: I am learning about brain models and neural simulations.
